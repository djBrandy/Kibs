CLINICAL TRIAL DATA</strong></h2><p>We and/or our subsidiaries undertake clinical studies within the EEA and the UK and we will use information from subjects’ medical records and other health data in order to improve healthcare.  As a pharmaceutical organisation, we have a legitimate interest in using information relating to your health for research studies, when you agree to take part in a research study. Our exception to the general provision at Article 9(1) GDPR not to process special categories of data is that processing is necessary for scientific research purposes in accordance with Article 89(1) GDPR. This means that we will use your data when we act as the data controller for such studies, collected in the course of a research study, in the ways needed to conduct and analyse the research study. The Informed Consent Form will provide further detail of the processing of your personal data should you be a subject of a study. Your rights to access, change or move your information are limited, as we need to manage your information in specific ways in order for the research to be reliable and accurate. If you withdraw from the study, we will keep the information about you that we have already obtained. To safeguard your rights, we will use the minimum personally-identifiable information possible.</p><h2><strong>3. CHANGE OF PURPOSE</strong></h2><p>We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose.</p><p>If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.</p><p>Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.</p><h2>4. <strong>INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS OF PERSONAL DATA</strong> </h2><p>Our primary location is based outside the European Economic Area, so the processing of your personal data may involve a transfer of data outside the EEA or UK.  Information on how to contact the DPO can be found in Section A of this Notice (“How to Contact Us”).</p><p>Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA or UK, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:</p><ul role="list"><li>We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission or UK Government.</li><li>Regarding transfers to the US, we are required to incorporate Standard Contractual Clauses in agreements for transfer from the EEA provided by the European Commission or from the UK by the International Data Transfer Agreement provided by the Information Commissioner’s Office in the UK in order to provide similar protection to personal data shared within Europe or the UK.</li></ul><h2>5. <strong>HOW LONG WE RETAIN YOUR PERSONAL DATA</strong></h2><p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.</p><p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p><p>In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p><h2>6. <strong>YOUR DATA PROTECTION RIGHTS</strong></h2><p>Under certain circumstances, if you are a person located within the EEA or UK you have the following data protection rights:</p><ul role="list"><li>access to your personal data.</li><li>correction of your personal data.</li><li>erasure of your personal data.</li><li>object to processing of your personal data.</li><li>restrict of processing your personal data.</li><li>transfer of your personal data.</li><li>withdraw consent to any consent that you have previously given.</li></ul><p>If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact our Data Protection Officer, Dr Phil Griffiths at sar@thedpo.co.uk.  You can also contact the Supervisory Authority in the country of your residence within the EU or UK for advice or to make a complaint.  Please be aware that your rights in relation to clinical research data may be limited.</p><p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights).  However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive.  Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p><p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights).  This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.  We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p><p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month.  Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests.  In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p></div></div></div></section><section
